## Exploratory user study

We conduct a small user study to showcase that even basic tasks like computing certain metadata in ML pipelines are difficult for data scientists without system support.

### Questions

* How long did you need for the first task?
* How long did you need for the second task?
* How did you experience the task? Was it clear what you had to do?
* How difficult did you find the tasks? Which tasks were most difficult? What was the biggest challenge?
* Did you have to work on such problems in the past?
* Did you complete the tasks? If not, why not? How long would it take you to finish them?
* Did the pipelines that you worked with in the past have rather higher or rather lower code quality?
* Would you use a tool which can automate these tasks?
